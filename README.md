# tic80-project
This is a simple game that i made using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_video_game_console">fantasy console</a>.I am making this just for fun,
The fantasy console used is <a href="https://tic80.com/">TIC-80</a>


<bold><h1>How to get the source code</h1></bold>
since github can not read the .tic files, the code is put in a .lua format in which you can get the source code from <a href="main.lua">main.lua</a> file.


<bold><h1>itch.io page</h1></bold>
I will be adding an <a href="https://www.itch.io/">itch.io</a> page for the project after the first version of the project is completed.
until then there will be no itch page for the proje ct for now.

<h1>Screenshots</h1>
<p>Screenshots will be added after further updates.</p>
