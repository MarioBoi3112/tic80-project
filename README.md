This is a simple game that i made using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_video_game_console">fantasy console</a>.I am making this just for fun
The fantasy console used is <a href="https://tic80.com/">TIC-80</a>
<h1>How to get the source code</h1>
since github can not read the .tic files, the code is put in a txt format and you can get the code from the main.txt file. 


<h1>itch.io page</h1>
I will be adding a itch.io page for the project after the first version of the project is completed.
until then there will be no itch page for the project for now.
